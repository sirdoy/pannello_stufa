### 🚧 v14.1 Tech Debt & Type Safety (In Progress)

**Milestone Goal:** Resolve accumulated known issues from v14.0 audit, eliminate `as any` casts across lib/ and app/, and remove dead code — leaving the codebase with zero known issues, tighter types, and a smaller surface area.

- [x] **Phase 113: Known Issues Fix** - Correct debug panel field names, remove stale code paths, fix FormModal flake (completed 2026-03-22)
- [ ] **Phase 114: Type Safety lib/** - Eliminate `as any` across lib/ layer (admin, network, notifications, rooms, device config, firebase)
- [ ] **Phase 115: Type Safety app/ Components** - Eliminate `as any` in component icon/spread/variant patterns and fix specific component types
- [ ] **Phase 116: Type Safety app/ Routes & Pages** - Eliminate `as any` in API routes and page files (scheduler, Netatmo, weather, thermostat/stove, service worker)
- [ ] **Phase 117: Dead Code & Cleanup** - Remove 48 unused utility exports, resolve 2 outstanding TODOs

## Phase Details

### Phase 113: Known Issues Fix
**Goal**: All known issues from the v14.0 audit are resolved — debug panel fields are accurate, stale stove code is removed, stove status is correctly typed, UI uses design system components, and FormModal is isolation-stable
**Depends on**: Phase 112 (v14.0 complete)
**Requirements**: ISSUE-01, ISSUE-02, ISSUE-03, ISSUE-04, ISSUE-05, ISSUE-06
**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):
  1. Debug panel HueTab displays correct field names (`connected`, `bri`) matching actual proxy response shape
  2. `UseStoveDataReturn.status` is typed as `StoveState` union — TypeScript rejects plain `string` assignments at call sites
  3. `staleness.cachedAt` code path is gone from stove hook — no dead null-check branch exists in the file
  4. CopyableIp renders a design system `Button` component — no raw `<button>` element remains in that file
  5. FormModal test suite passes in isolation without ordering dependencies
**Plans:** 1/1 plans complete

Plans:
- [x] 113-01-PLAN.md — Fix all 6 known issues (HueTab fields, stove staleness, CopyableIp button, FormModal flake)

### Phase 114: Type Safety lib/
**Goal**: All `as any` casts in the lib/ layer are replaced with proper typed interfaces — adminDbGet returns typed values, browser APIs have typed wrappers, and service utilities access data without unsafe casts
**Depends on**: Phase 113
**Requirements**: TYPE-01, TYPE-02, TYPE-03, TYPE-04, TYPE-05, TYPE-06
**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):
  1. `adminDbGet()` calls return typed values — TypeScript infers the correct type at call sites without manual casts
  2. `navigator.connection` accesses are guarded by a typed Network Information API interface — no `as any` remains
  3. `Notification.maxActions` has a type guard — accessing it does not require a cast
  4. `useRoomStatus` room data is typed — no `as any[]` cast remains in the hook
  5. `unifiedDeviceConfigService` meta access is typed — no `as any` for meta property access
**Plans**: TBD

### Phase 115: Type Safety app/ Components
**Goal**: Component files in app/ have no `as any` casts — icon props, spread patterns, variant props, and specific component internals are all expressible through proper TypeScript types
**Depends on**: Phase 114
**Requirements**: TYPE-07, TYPE-08, TYPE-09, TYPE-10, TYPE-11, TYPE-12
**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):
  1. Icon props (`<X /> as any`) are eliminated — icon components accept a typed prop (e.g., `React.ComponentType`) without casting
  2. Component spread patterns (`{...({} as any)}`) are eliminated — spreads use typed objects
  3. Variant prop casts are eliminated — variant props use typed union literals matching CVA definitions
  4. `DeviceCard` banner, action, and toast props align — no structural mismatch requires a cast at usage sites
  5. `TransitionLink` and `ControlButton` internal types are explicit — no `_warned` or return type casts remain
**Plans**: TBD

### Phase 116: Type Safety app/ Routes & Pages
**Goal**: API route files and page components in app/ have no `as any` casts — scheduler, Netatmo, weather, thermostat/stove, and service worker files are fully typed
**Depends on**: Phase 115
**Requirements**: TYPE-13, TYPE-14, TYPE-15, TYPE-16, TYPE-17
**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):
  1. Scheduler route `adminDbGet` calls have specific return interfaces — no `as any` casts remain in that file
  2. Netatmo homestatus `modulesFromTopology` is typed — battery functions receive typed module objects
  3. Weather forecast route response is typed with an interface — no `as any` in the response handling path
  4. Thermostat and stove page prop casts are eliminated — props flow with proper types from server to client components
  5. `sw.ts` browser API casts use proper interfaces — no `as any` for Push API, Notification API, or Cache API access
**Plans**: TBD

### Phase 117: Dead Code & Cleanup
**Goal**: The 48 unused utility exports identified by knip are removed, and two outstanding service TODOs are resolved with proper implementations
**Depends on**: Phase 116
**Requirements**: CLEAN-01, CLEAN-02, CLEAN-03
**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):
  1. `knip` reports zero unused exports in utility files (the 48 identified exports are gone)
  2. `notificationService.ts` TODO is resolved — cleanup logic runs in an API route, not inline in the service
  3. `healthMonitoring.ts` TODO is resolved — stove STARTING state has grace period tracking before triggering alerts
**Plans**: TBD
