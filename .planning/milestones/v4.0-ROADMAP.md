# Milestone v4.0: Advanced UI Components

**Status:** SHIPPED 2026-02-05
**Phases:** 30-36
**Total Plans:** 24

## Overview

This milestone added 12 advanced UI components to the Ember Noir design system: Tabs, Accordion, Data Table, Command Palette, Context Menu, Popover, Sheet, Kbd, Confirmation Dialog, Form Modal, and supporting components. The approach built from foundation (Radix primitives) through increasingly complex components, with immediate application after each component was built. The milestone concluded with a micro-interactions system and application-wide integration to ensure consistent UX across all pages.

## Phases

**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):
  1. User can click trigger to open/close Popover and it positions correctly within viewport

## Milestone Summary

**Key Decisions:**

- Radix UI primitives for all interactive components (accessibility-first)
- cmdk library for Command Palette with fuzzy search
- TanStack Table for DataTable (industry standard, comprehensive features)
- CSS-only animation system (no Framer Motion - bundle size concern)
- Namespace component pattern (Tabs.List, Accordion.Item, etc.)
- CVA variants for all component states
- Selective reduced motion (preserve functional animations like spinners)

**Issues Resolved:**

- Mobile context menu via long-press hook (500ms threshold)
- iOS safe area handling for bottom tabs
- DataTable keyboard navigation (roving tabindex pattern)
- Animation token organization in @theme block

**Issues Deferred:**

- CMDK-05 (recent commands) deferred per user decision - always start fresh
- Advanced TanStack features (grouping, column resize) - over-engineering for current needs
- Framer Motion - bundle size concern, CSS sufficient

**Technical Debt Incurred:**

None - milestone completed with no known technical debt.
