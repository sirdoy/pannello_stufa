# Requirements: Pannello Stufa

**Defined:** 2026-02-17
**Core Value:** I dispositivi vengono riconosciuti automaticamente dopo il riavvio del browser e le notifiche arrivano sempre (100% delivery rate per dispositivi registrati).

## v8.1 Requirements

Requirements for Masonry Dashboard milestone. Each maps to roadmap phases.

### Layout

- [x] **LAYOUT-01**: User sees dashboard cards in masonry layout on desktop (2 columns, no vertical gaps between cards of different heights) — Phase 68, verified
- [x] **LAYOUT-02**: Card order matches user settings (card 0 = top-left, card 1 = top-right, card 2 = below card 0, etc.) — Phase 68, verified
- [x] **LAYOUT-03**: Mobile layout unchanged (single column, linear order) — Phase 68, verified

### Animation

- [x] **ANIM-01**: Cards animate with existing spring-in stagger on page load — Phase 68, flat-index stagger preserved
- [x] **ANIM-02**: Cards transition smoothly when height changes (polling updates, expand/collapse) — Phase 68, CSS transition-all

### Edge Cases

- [x] **EDGE-01**: Layout works correctly with 1 visible card (full-width or left-aligned) — Phase 69, right column removed from DOM
- [x] **EDGE-02**: Layout works correctly with odd number of visible cards — Phase 69, left.length === right.length + 1 verified by unit tests
- [x] **EDGE-03**: Error boundary fallback has minimum height to prevent column collapse — Phase 69, min-h-[160px] on Card

## Future Requirements

None — v8.1 is a focused layout milestone.

## Out of Scope

| Feature | Reason |
|---------|--------|
| Drag & drop card reorder from home page | Separate milestone — settings reorder is sufficient |
| 3+ column layouts | 2 columns sufficient for current card count (6 devices) |
| CSS Grid masonry spec (`grid-template-rows: masonry`) | No stable browser support as of Feb 2026 |
| JS masonry libraries (react-masonry-css, masonic) | Abandoned/SSR-incompatible, overkill for 6 cards |
| CSS `column-count` masonry | Fills column-first, breaks user-configured card order |

## Traceability

Which phases cover which requirements. Updated during roadmap creation.

| Requirement | Phase | Status |
|-------------|-------|--------|
| LAYOUT-01 | Phase 68 | ✅ Complete |
| LAYOUT-02 | Phase 68 | ✅ Complete |
| LAYOUT-03 | Phase 68 | ✅ Complete |
| ANIM-01 | Phase 68 | ✅ Complete |
| ANIM-02 | Phase 68 | ✅ Complete |
