# Phase 143: Netatmo Migration - Context

**Gathered:** 2026-03-27
**Status:** Ready for planning

<domain>
## Phase Boundary

Migrate Netatmo thermostat data from HTTP polling to WebSocket as primary data channel. This requires extracting a `useThermostatData` hook (currently data fetching is inline in ThermostatCard.tsx and thermostat/page.tsx — unlike all other providers which have dedicated data hooks). HTTP polling becomes automatic fallback when WS is unavailable. An adapter layer normalises the raw `Record<string, unknown>` WS payload into the existing typed Netatmo shape. No UI changes.

## Implementation Decisions

### Hook Extraction (prerequisite — unique to Netatmo)
- **D-01:** Unlike all other providers (stove, network, lights, sonos, dirigera), Netatmo has NO dedicated data hook. ThermostatCard.tsx and thermostat/page.tsx both fetch data independently with inline `useAdaptivePolling` / `setInterval`. A `useThermostatData` hook must be extracted FIRST before WS migration.
- **D-02:** The hook should be created at `app/components/devices/thermostat/hooks/useThermostatData.ts` following the directory convention of other provider hooks.
- **D-03:** The extracted hook encapsulates: connection check (health), topology fetch (homesdata), status polling (homestatus), staleness tracking. Both ThermostatCard and thermostat/page.tsx consume it.

### WS Payload Adapter
- **D-04:** The WS `netatmo` topic sends the raw Netatmo cloud API `homestatus` response as `Record<string, unknown>`. The envelope is `{ body: { home: { id, rooms: [...], modules: [...] } }, status: "ok", time_server: number }`. An adapter function maps this into the existing internal interfaces used by ThermostatCard and page.tsx.
- **D-05:** The adapter extracts `body.home.rooms` and `body.home.modules` from the raw WS payload and maps them to the existing `RoomStatus[]` and `ModuleStatus[]` shapes used by the components. Field mapping: `therm_measured_temperature` → `temperature`, `therm_setpoint_temperature` → `setpoint`, `therm_setpoint_mode` → `mode`, `heating_power_request > 0` → `heating`.
- **D-06:** If the WS payload is `null` (Netatmo cloud hasn't responded since server start), the adapter returns null and the hook falls back to HTTP polling.

### Data Scope (WS vs HTTP)
- **D-07:** `homestatus` (room temperatures, heating status, module battery/reachable) — via WS as primary, HTTP polling as fallback.
- **D-08:** `homesdata` (topology: home structure, rooms list, module list, schedules) — remains as HTTP side-fetch. This is structural data that changes rarely (only when rooms/devices are added/removed). Fetched on mount only.
- **D-09:** Schedules (active schedule, switch schedule, sync schedule) — remain as HTTP via existing `useScheduleData` hook and API routes. Not part of WS payload.
- **D-10:** Health check (connection status) — remains as HTTP side-fetch on mount.
- **D-11:** Calibration, mode changes, temperature setpoints — remain as HTTP POST commands (WS is read-only push per spec).

### Fallback Trigger (carried from Phase 140/141/142)
- **D-12:** Same pattern as all other providers: `readyState === OPEN` → WS primary, polling suppressed via `interval: isWsConnected ? null : existingInterval`. When WS disconnects, polling activates immediately.
- **D-13:** `alwaysActive: false` preserved — thermostat is non-safety-critical (matches current ThermostatCard behavior).

### Side-Fetch Pattern (carried from Phase 140)
- **D-14:** Side-fetches (topology/homesdata, health) fire on mount. Status side-fetches are not needed — WS provides the homestatus data directly.
- **D-15:** Side-fetches use ref pattern to avoid stale closures in WS useEffect callbacks.

### Staleness Handling (carried from Phase 140/141/142)
- **D-16:** WS messages: `isStale=false`, use message `ts` field as freshness indicator. HTTP polling: continue using existing staleness logic.

### WS Subscription Pattern (carried from Phase 140/141/142)
- **D-17:** `subscribe('netatmo', handleMessage)` in useEffect with `unsubscribe()` cleanup.
- **D-18:** Ref pattern for side-effect functions to avoid stale closures.

### Claude's Discretion
- Whether the adapter is a standalone utility function or inline in the handleMessage callback
- How to structure the hook's return type to serve both ThermostatCard (summary view) and page.tsx (full room list)
- Whether topology should be re-fetched after WS data updates or only on mount
- Test mocking approach for WS subscribe/unsubscribe
- Whether to preserve the page.tsx `setInterval(30000)` as-is for fallback or migrate to `useAdaptivePolling`

## Existing Code Insights

### Reusable Assets
- `useWebSocketContext()` — WS connection state and subscribe/unsubscribe API (Phase 139)
- `useAdaptivePolling()` — Polling with visibility awareness, `interval: null` disables (used in ThermostatCard)
- `useDeviceStaleness('thermostat')` — Existing staleness tracking for thermostat device
- `useScheduleData()` — Schedule management hook (stays independent, not part of WS migration)
- `useRetryableCommand()` — Command retry infrastructure (stays independent)
- `ReadyState` from `useWebSocketManager` — WS connection state enum

### Established Patterns
- **WS-primary + HTTP fallback:** 5 providers already migrated with identical pattern (subscribe in useEffect, `isWsConnected ? null : interval` for polling control)
- **Ref pattern:** All migrated hooks use refs for side-fetch functions to avoid stale closures in WS callbacks
- **Adapter in handleMessage:** Stove maps `stove_state` → `status`, lights convert `Record<string, HueLight>` → array. Netatmo adapter will be most complex (nested Netatmo API envelope → flat internal types).
- **Side-fetch on mount:** Structural data (topology) fetched once on mount via HTTP, not through WS

### Integration Points
- `app/components/DashboardCards.tsx` — Imports ThermostatCard, no change needed (hook extraction is internal)
- `app/thermostat/page.tsx` — Will consume new useThermostatData hook instead of inline fetching
- `app/thermostat/components/ThermostatTabs.tsx` — Receives data as props from page.tsx
- `app/components/netatmo/RoomCard.tsx` — Receives room data as props from page.tsx

</code_context>

<specifics>
## Specific Ideas

- The Netatmo WS adapter is the most complex of all 6 providers because the WS payload is raw `Record<string, unknown>` (the full Netatmo cloud API response), not a typed interface like the other 5 providers. Robust type guards / parsing are needed.
- ThermostatCard currently uses `topology ? 60000 : null` to gate polling on connection — the hook should preserve this behavior (only poll when connected/topology loaded).
- The page.tsx uses a raw `setInterval(30000)` instead of `useAdaptivePolling` — the hook extraction should normalise this to use `useAdaptivePolling` for consistency.
