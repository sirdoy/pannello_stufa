  <name>Task 1: Run all tests and verify no regressions</name>
  <files></files>
  <action>
Run comprehensive test suite to verify no regressions:

```bash
# Run all tests
npm test

# Check for any failing tests
# Expected: All tests pass
```

Review any failures and document if they're:
1. Pre-existing issues (not caused by this phase)
2. New issues introduced by migration (need fixing)
3. Test updates needed due to component changes

If new issues found, document them for gap closure.

  <what-built>
Complete design system migration of all application pages:

**User-facing pages:**
- Dashboard (home page) - 16-01
- Stove control page - 16-02
- Thermostat control page - 16-03
- Lights control page - 16-04
- Monitoring dashboard - 16-05
- Schedule management - 16-06

**Settings pages:**
- Notifications settings - 16-07
- Device settings - 16-10
- Theme settings - 16-10

**Admin/Debug pages:**
- Design system showcase - 16-08
- Debug main page - 16-11
- Debug logs - 16-11
- Debug transitions - 16-11

**Note:** Camera page (PAGE-05) does not exist in this codebase - no migration needed.
  </what-built>
  <how-to-verify>
1. Start dev server: `npm run dev`

2. Visit each page and verify visual consistency:

   **User-facing pages:**
   - localhost:3000 (Dashboard)
   - localhost:3000/stove (Stove)
   - localhost:3000/thermostat (Thermostat)
   - localhost:3000/lights (Lights)
   - localhost:3000/monitoring (Monitoring)
   - localhost:3000/schedule (Schedule)

   **Settings pages:**
   - localhost:3000/settings/notifications (Notifications)
   - localhost:3000/settings/devices (Devices)
   - localhost:3000/settings/theme (Theme)

   **Admin/Debug pages:**
   - localhost:3000/debug/design-system (Design System)
   - localhost:3000/debug (Debug API)
   - localhost:3000/debug/logs (Debug Logs)
   - localhost:3000/debug/transitions (Transitions)

3. For each page, check:
   - [ ] Page loads without errors
   - [ ] Cards have consistent styling (glass effect, borders)
   - [ ] Buttons use correct variants (ember for primary, subtle for secondary)
   - [ ] Headings have proper hierarchy (h1 > h2 > h3)
   - [ ] Text uses design system variants
   - [ ] Responsive behavior works (test mobile viewport)

4. Test key interactions:
   - [ ] Stove: ignite/shutdown buttons work
   - [ ] Thermostat: mode switching works
   - [ ] Lights: slider brightness control works
   - [ ] Schedule: override sheet opens
   - [ ] Notifications: test notification sends
   - [ ] Settings/devices: toggle works
   - [ ] Settings/theme: theme switching works

5. Check dark/light mode:
   - Toggle theme at /settings/theme
   - Verify all pages look correct in both modes

6. Check for console errors:
   - Open browser dev tools
   - No component-related errors
  </how-to-verify>
  <resume-signal>Type "approved" if all pages look consistent and work correctly, or describe issues found</resume-signal>
</task>

</tasks>

<verification>
Human verification confirms:
1. All pages use design system consistently
2. No visual regressions
3. Key interactions work
4. No console errors
</verification>

<success_criteria>
- Human approval received
- All tests pass
- No blocking issues identified
</success_criteria>

<output>
After completion, create `.planning/phases/16-page-migration/16-09-SUMMARY.md`
