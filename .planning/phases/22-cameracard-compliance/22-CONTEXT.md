## Phase Boundary

Replace all raw HTML elements in camera components with design system components. Covers CameraCard, EventPreviewModal, and HlsPlayer. No new camera features — compliance only.

## Implementation Decisions

### General Approach
- Follow established v3.1 compliance patterns from Phases 19-21
- Apply same Button migration strategy used for other device cards
- Maintain existing functionality while swapping raw elements

### Claude's Discretion
- Button variant selection (subtle, ghost, ember) based on visual context
- Icon-only vs icon+text based on existing patterns
- Player control layout and grouping
- Modal button styling and placement
