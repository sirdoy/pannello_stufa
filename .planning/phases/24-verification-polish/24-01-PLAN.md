<objective>
Run ESLint verification against all device components migrated in Phases 19-23 and document results in a verification report.

Purpose: Satisfy VERIFY-01 (All device cards pass ESLint with no hard-coded color warnings) with objective evidence.
Output: Verification report documenting ESLint execution results against device components.

<scope>
**Target files (device components from Phases 19-23):**
- `app/components/devices/stove/StoveCard.js` (Phase 19)
- `app/components/devices/thermostat/ThermostatCard.js` (Phase 20)
- `app/components/devices/lights/LightsCard.js` (Phase 21)
- `app/components/devices/camera/CameraCard.js` (Phase 22)
- `app/thermostat/page.js` (Phase 23)
- `app/components/ui/InfoBox.js` (Phase 23)

**Supporting files that may also be checked:**
- `app/components/devices/camera/EventPreviewModal.js` (Phase 22)
- `app/components/devices/camera/HlsPlayer.js` (Phase 22)

**Out of scope:**
- Schedule management UI (`thermostat/schedule/components/`) - separate concern from v2.0
- Admin/debug pages - not in compliance milestone scope
- Generic UI components - already compliant from Phase 11-18
</scope>

<tasks>

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 1: Run ESLint on device components</name>
  <files>.planning/phases/24-verification-polish/24-VERIFICATION-REPORT.md</files>
  <action>
Execute ESLint against the specific device component files:

```bash
npx eslint app/components/devices/stove/StoveCard.js \
           app/components/devices/thermostat/ThermostatCard.js \
           app/components/devices/lights/LightsCard.js \
           app/components/devices/camera/CameraCard.js \
           app/components/devices/camera/EventPreviewModal.js \
           app/components/devices/camera/HlsPlayer.js \
           app/thermostat/page.js \
           app/components/ui/InfoBox.js \
           --format stylish 2>&1
```

Capture the full output.

Look specifically for:
- `tailwindcss/no-arbitrary-value` warnings
- Any hard-coded color patterns (`text-[#`, `bg-[#`)

Create initial verification report at `.planning/phases/24-verification-polish/24-VERIFICATION-REPORT.md`:

```markdown
# Phase 24: Design System Compliance Verification Report

**Generated:** [date]
**Phase:** 24-verification-polish
**Status:** In Progress

## VERIFY-01: ESLint Verification

### Command Executed
\`\`\`bash
npx eslint [files] --format stylish
\`\`\`

### Results

| File | Warnings | Errors | Status |
|------|----------|--------|--------|
| StoveCard.js | 0 | 0 | PASS |
| ThermostatCard.js | 0 | 0 | PASS |
| LightsCard.js | 0 | 0 | PASS |
| CameraCard.js | 0 | 0 | PASS |
| EventPreviewModal.js | 0 | 0 | PASS |
| HlsPlayer.js | 0 | 0 | PASS |
| page.js (thermostat) | 0 | 0 | PASS |
| InfoBox.js | 0 | 0 | PASS |

### ESLint Output
\`\`\`
[paste full eslint output here]
\`\`\`

### tailwindcss/no-arbitrary-value Violations
- None found / [list any found]

### Evidence
- ESLint execution: [timestamp]
- Total files checked: 8
- Total warnings: 0
- Total errors: 0
```

If any violations are found, document them with file path, line number, and the specific violation.
  </action>
  <verify>`cat .planning/phases/24-verification-polish/24-VERIFICATION-REPORT.md | grep -c "VERIFY-01"` returns 1</verify>
  <done>ESLint verification section created in report with execution evidence</done>
</task>

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 2: Check ESLint configuration for arbitrary value rule</name>
  <files>.planning/phases/24-verification-polish/24-VERIFICATION-REPORT.md</files>
  <action>
Verify ESLint is properly configured to catch arbitrary values:

```bash
grep -A 10 "no-arbitrary-value" eslint.config.mjs
```

Document the configuration in the verification report:

```markdown
## ESLint Configuration Audit

### tailwindcss/no-arbitrary-value Rule

**Status:** [warn/error/off]
**Ignored Properties:** [list from config]

\`\`\`javascript
// From eslint.config.mjs
[paste relevant config section]
\`\`\`

**Assessment:** Configuration [is/is not] adequate for detecting hard-coded colors.
```

If the rule is set to "off" or missing, flag as configuration issue.
  </action>
  <verify>`grep -c "no-arbitrary-value" .planning/phases/24-verification-polish/24-VERIFICATION-REPORT.md` returns at least 2</verify>
  <done>ESLint configuration documented in verification report</done>
</task>

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 3: Summarize VERIFY-01 status</name>
  <files>.planning/phases/24-verification-polish/24-VERIFICATION-REPORT.md</files>
  <action>
Update the verification report with final VERIFY-01 status:

```markdown
## Requirements Summary

| Requirement | Status | Evidence |
|-------------|--------|----------|
| VERIFY-01 | VERIFIED / FAILED | ESLint output shows 0 arbitrary value warnings in device components |
| VERIFY-02 | Pending | Plan 24-02 |
| VERIFY-03 | Pending | Plan 24-02 |
| VERIFY-04 | Pending | Plan 24-03 |
```

If there were any issues found:
- Document remediation needed
- Add to "Issues Found" section
- Update status to FAILED with details

If all passed:
- Update status to VERIFIED
- Note clean ESLint execution
  </action>
  <verify>Verification report exists with Requirements Summary table</verify>
  <done>VERIFY-01 status documented with pass/fail determination</done>
</task>

</tasks>

<verification>
1. `.planning/phases/24-verification-polish/24-VERIFICATION-REPORT.md` exists
2. Report contains ESLint execution output
3. Report contains configuration audit
4. VERIFY-01 status is documented as VERIFIED or FAILED with evidence
</verification>

<success_criteria>
- ESLint executed against all 8 target device component files
- ESLint configuration for arbitrary value detection documented
- Verification report created with objective evidence
- VERIFY-01 requirement status clearly documented
</success_criteria>
